Hello Prof. Martin,

The assignment2 requires us to submit only one file, but I changed some code in the assignment1, because the feedback of assignment 1 showed that I did not implement the enable/disable function, so in the assignment2, I finished it.

In the "sensors_qemu.c" file, I implemented the data_poll() and control_activate() function, which is the reason why I have to modify some code in the kernel driver.

The app can displayed the correct data in acceleration sensor and magnetic sensor. But the time of starting up the system is very long in my laptop, and I am not sure if the same thing happened in your system.


The version of the sensors.qemu.c file I downloaded is the android-5.1.0_r5.

Best regards,

Hongyu ZHOU (Oscar)
